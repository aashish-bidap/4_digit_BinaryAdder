# Goal 

Train a neural network to learn how to add two four-bit numbers. The result is encoded as a five-bit number.  

# Dataset:<br>
The dataset includes a file where each row in the file contains two numbers labeled x, and y encoded in binary format with four bits each. It also contains the result of the addition of those two numbers encoded in binary format of 4 bits + 1 bit to carry (effectively 5 bits).
